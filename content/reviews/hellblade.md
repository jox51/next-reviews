Self-described as an "[independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game_development "Indie game development") [AAA game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)>) "AAA (video game industry)")", _Hellblade_ was created by a team of approximately twenty developers led by writer and director Tameem Antoniades. The game blends different gameplay mechanics and concepts like [puzzle solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game "Puzzle video game"), [psychological horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_horror "Psychological horror") and melee combat. [Voice acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting "Voice acting") is an integral part of the game, while its [cutscenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene "Cutscene") combine [motion capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture "Motion capture") by Melina Juergens, and [live action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action "Live action") performances by other actors. The game's narrative serves as a [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") for the character's struggle with [psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis "Psychosis"), as Senua, who suffers from the condition but believes it to be a curse, is haunted by an entity known as the "Darkness", [voices in her head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination "Auditory hallucination") known as "Furies", and memories from her past. To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with [neuroscientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist "Neuroscientist"), mental health specialists, and people living with the condition.
