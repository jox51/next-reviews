**_Hollow Knight_** is a 2017 [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania "Metroidvania") video game developed and published by [independent developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game "Indie game") Team Cherry. In the game, the player controls the Knight, a nameless [insectoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectoids_in_science_fiction "Insectoids in science fiction") warrior, who explores Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease, known as the infection. The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous [bosses](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)>) "Boss (video games)"). Players have the opportunity to unlock new abilities as they explore each location, along with pieces of lore and [flavour text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_text "Flavour text") that are spread throughout the kingdom.

The concept behind _Hollow Knight_ was conceived in 2013 in the [Ludum Dare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare "Ludum Dare") [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam "Game jam"). Team Cherry wanted to create a game inspired by older [platformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game "Platform game") that replicated the explorational aspects of its influences. Inspirations for the game include _[Faxanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faxanadu "Faxanadu")_ , _[Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid "Metroid")_ , _[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link")_ , and _[Mega Man X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X "Mega Man X")_ . Development was partially funded through a [Kickstarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter "Kickstarter") crowdfunding campaign that raised over [A$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar "Australian dollar")57,000 by the end of 2014. It was released for [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows"), [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"), and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS"), in early 2017 and for the [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch "Nintendo Switch"), [PlayStation 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4 "PlayStation 4"), and [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One "Xbox One") in 2018. After release, Team Cherry supported the game with four free [expansions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content "Downloadable content").
