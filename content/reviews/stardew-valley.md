**_Stardew Valley_** is a [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_video_game "Simulation video game")[role-playing video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game "Role-playing video game") developed by [Eric &#34;ConcernedApe&#34; Barone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Barone_(developer)>) "Eric Barone (developer)"). Players take the role of a character who inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game was released for [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows") in February 2016 before being [ported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_port "Video game port") to other platforms. _Stardew Valley_ is [open-ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay "Nonlinear gameplay"), allowing players to grow crops, raise livestock, fish, cook, mine, forage, and socialize with the townspeople, including the ability to marry and have children. It allows up to four players to play online together.

Barone developed _Stardew Valley_ by himself over four and a half years. He was heavily inspired by the _[Story of Seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Seasons "Story of Seasons")_ series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those games. He used it as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. British studio [Chucklefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chucklefish "Chucklefish") approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it.
